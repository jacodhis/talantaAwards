            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                ETA is a non-profit organization made up of a group of like-minded young individuals who are creative,
                self-motivated, and have a diversity of professional, talent, and academic backgrounds. We want to honor
                the new breed of Entertainers who are exceptional, hardworking, determined, consistent, and extremely
                intelligent, but who are rarely given the attention, opportunity, and support they deserve, particularly
                in the mainstream media and events world.

                        those in surrounding countries. The importance and usefulness of Kenyan music and arts extends beyond
                        enjoyment to the county and national economies.

                        important role in keeping Kenya's youth active and creative, as well as away from dangerous
